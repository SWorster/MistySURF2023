This repository contains our current work with Smith College's Misty II Advanced.

So far, we have made the following:

- Introduction.md, an in-depth starter on Misty's operation and capabilities
- JavaScript tutorials, adapted from those found on Misty's documentation site
- Python tutorials, _heavily_ adapted from the JS tutorials
- Onboard JS basics, although we haven't worked with that extensively
- Controller guide, for how to make and program an Arduino-based joystick controller
- Python skills, a collection of programs for Misty

This will be continually updated throughout the summer as we continue our work. Here's an overview of the areas we plan on exploring further:

- Audio localization
- SLAM mapping
- Onboard JS and Python
- Speech and conversations
- Object detection
